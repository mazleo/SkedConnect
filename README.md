# SkedConnect

A personal API that integrates SkedPal with Trello.

The app listens for activity in Trello and creates tasks in SkedPal for automatic scheduling. It takes information, like task duration, a plan as to what times and days to schedule, due dates, etc. and sends it to SkedPal.

I prefer a Kanban UI to organize my tasks over a nested todo list like SkedPal has 🤷‍♀️. SkedPal then taskes care of scheduling it in my calendar (because I don't want to do that myself).
